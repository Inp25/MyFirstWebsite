    <h1>The Mac</h1>
  </header>

  <p>
    The Macintosh, commonly known as the Mac, was first introduced by Apple in 1984. It was one of the first personal computers to popularize the graphical user interface, making computing more accessible to everyday people. The original Macintosh had a 9-inch black and white display, a mouse, and an easy-to-use operating system that set it apart from other computers of the time.
    Over the years, Apple released many different models of the Mac. The Macintosh II, introduced in 1987, supported color displays and more expandability. Later in the 1990s, the iMac became famous for its all-in-one design with colorful, translucent cases. This bold design choice helped Apple stand out during a difficult period for the company.
    In the 2000s, the Mac line continued to evolve with the introduction of MacBook laptops, the Mac mini, and the Mac Pro. The MacBook Air, launched in 2008, was the thinnest laptop of its time and pushed the trend toward lightweight, portable computers.
    Apple&apos;s transition to Intel processors in 2006 gave the Mac a huge boost in performance and compatibility. More recently, Apple has transitioned again to its own Apple Silicon chips, starting with the M1 processor in 2020. These chips offer impressive speed, energy efficiency, and long battery life, making the newest Macs some of the most powerful computers available today.
    Modern Macs, including the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac Studio, are known for their sleek design, Retina displays, and seamless integration with other Apple devices. Features like Handoff, Universal Clipboard, and iCloud make it easy to move between a Mac, iPhone, or iPad.
    The Mac has gone from being a bold experiment in personal computing to a central part of Apple&apos;s product lineup. With a focus on design, performance, and user experience, the Mac continues to be a favorite choice for students, professionals, and creatives all around the world.
