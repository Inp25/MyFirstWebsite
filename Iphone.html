    <h1>The iPhone</h1>
  </header>
  <p>
   The iPhone was first introduced by Apple in 2007 and completely changed the way people thought about phones. The original model combined a phone, an iPod, and an internet communicator in one device. It had a 3.5&ndash;inch touchscreen and a simple design, setting the foundation for modern smartphones.
In 2008, the iPhone 3G added faster internet and the App Store, opening the door to millions of apps. The 3GS followed with better speed and video recording, showing how quickly the iPhone was evolving.
The iPhone 4 in 2010 introduced the sharp Retina display and FaceTime video calls, while the 4S brought Siri, Apple&apos;s voice assistant. A couple of years later, the iPhone 5 made the screen taller and introduced the Lightning connector.
Apple moved to larger displays with the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus in 2014, and also introduced Apple Pay. Later, the iPhone 7 removed the headphone jack, pushing wireless audio forward, and added a dual&ndash;camera system on the Plus model.
The iPhone X in 2017 was another major leap, with its edge&ndash;to&ndash;edge OLED screen, Face ID, and the removal of the Home button. Since then, models like the iPhone 12, 13, 14, and 15 have continued to add improvements such as 5G, stronger glass, better cameras, longer battery life, and even a new USB&ndash;C connector.
Today, the iPhone is more than just a phone&ndash;it&apos;s a powerful device for communication, photography, entertainment, and productivity, with each version building on Apple&apos;s focus on design and innovation.</p>
