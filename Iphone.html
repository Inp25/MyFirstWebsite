  <p>
    The iPhone, first introduced in 2007, revolutionized the smartphone industry with its multi-touch screen and intuitive interface. Combining a phone, iPod, and internet device into one, the iPhone set the standard for modern smartphones.
    Over the years, Apple has continued to improve the iPhone with faster processors, better cameras, and new features like Face ID and 5G connectivity. Each generation pushes the limits of what a smartphone can do.
    Today, the iPhone remains one of Apple&apos;s most successful products, offering models like the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15, which deliver cutting-edge performance, advanced photography, and deep integration with Apple&apos;s ecosystem.
